//
//Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, 
//you access the data in objects through what are called properties.
//Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a dog

//Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name" : "Javidu",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1 ,
  "friends": ["everyone"]
  
};
